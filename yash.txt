You step into a dark, gloomy room with only one dull light hanging from the
ceiling. You notice that you now have 3 hearts above your head again. As you
start to look around, you see lots of blobs floating mysteriously in the air.
They are an unusual green and yellow in colour and their shape feels familiar.
However, you can't identify what they are. You get goosebumps on your arms and
start to feel scared, so you slowly tremble towards the door on the other side
of the room. Ah yes- you think tp youself, those blobs are infact viruses!
Standing in awe of these mysterious viruses, you realise that the viruses are
slowly floating towards you. You try to run away, but your legs are frozen to
the floor. Suddenly, one of the viruses has inched itself closer towards you,
almost at eye level, and it asks you a question in a glitchy, sniffly voice.
