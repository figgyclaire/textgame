You stumble around aimlessly through the dark corridor, but turn back to fetch
the lantern, regretting your decision of not grabbing it before. When you pick
up the lantern, it suddenly lights- scaring you. You look around only to see the
room is made from cold, dark walls, unlike the other interesting levels you have
passed. You have noticed that you have reached a dead end. Your only choice now
is to head right, down the dark corridor.
