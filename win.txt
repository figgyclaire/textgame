Congratulations! You have finally learnt how to be safe on the internet! 

A blinding white light surrounds you and you fall back in your chair. You feel
relieved and laughed happily as you knew you were back. On your screen, you see
the ad again but this time, it said, “be safe!” and it fades away, replaced by a
other ad. Now you turn your depressing life around and start a charity that help
to inform people about what to do and not to do on the internet and how to be
safe.
