You slide out of the tunnel, dazed and confused. To your left, you see a lantern
and to your right, a long, dark corridor awaits you.
Go left or right?
left-
You grab the lantern, it suddenly lights- scaring you. You look around only to \
see the room is made from cold, dark walls, unlike the other interesting \
levels you have passed. You have noticed that you have reached a dead end. \
Your only choice now is to head right, down the dark corridoor.
right-
You stumble around aimlessly through the dark corridor, but turn back to fetch \
the lantern, regretting your decision of not grabbing it before. When you pick \
up the lantern, it suddenly lights- scaring you. You look around only to see \
the room is made from cold, dark walls, unlike the other interesting levels \
you have passed. You have noticed that you have reached a dead end. Your only \
choice now is to head right, down the dark corridor.
continue-
Your lantern illuminates the corridor, revealing wires lining the roof. \
Confused, you continue until you stumble onto something- maybe a wire, until \
suddenly, the wires on top of the roof start to illuminate- revealing neon \
lights that will guide you through the tunnel.\n\nWhen you reach the end of \
the tunnel, you come to another dark room- you reach for you lantern, but it \
won't turn on and suddenly, it disappears into thin air. Standing in the dark, \
you carefully and slowly walk forward, reaching out to ensure you don't crash \
in to anything.\nDo you want to look for a light switch or walk around the \
room? (Use "l" for light switch or use "w" for walk around room)
light switch-
You travel alongside the edge of the room, feeling the wall in search for a \
light switch. When you get back to the doorway where you entered, you \
discovered there is no light switch. Your only choice now is to look around \
the room.
look around room-
You walk around slowly, with outstretched arms, until suddenly, you feel \
something in the middle of the room. It feels like a pedestal with a large \
button on top.\n\nYou decide to press the button but when you pressed it, \
large, bright rectangles appear to be floating in the air. No, that can't be \
right- you think to yourself, and blink several times in confusion, allowing \
your eyes to adjust. When everything is clearer, you realise the floating \
rectangles are your posts, searches, passwords and your...PERSONAL INFORMATION\
!?!?!?!
