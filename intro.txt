You are sitting in your dark, cold and damp basement. You \
can hear the soft pattering of rain and the clicks of your keyboard keys. \
Staring into the screen, you close your social media tabs, close a kind-of \
sketchy website called BuyThis, all the games you downloaded and finally your \
hacking platform.\n\nJust as you were about to Google "Funny Memes" to finish \
off your night when suddenly an ad flashes onto your screen. This is what you \
have been looking for your whole life- Gumanji, the game where the best of the \
best gamers battle it out for the ultimate glory. You\'ve never seen a single \
picture, review or anything about this game other that its name and how hard \
it is to come across. Engulfed by happiness, you immediately click on the \
screen.\n\nSuddenly your screen brightens, the basement starts to shake, your \
cat shrieks and runs away and your body seems to be dissolving into the \
computer screen...
