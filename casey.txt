You're lying on the floor, your stomach feels sick and your vision is blurry.
As you stand up, you feel normal again. You look up and notice 3 hearts above
your head. What is this and where am I? It feels like something out of a video
game. As your eyes unblur, you notice you are in your year 7 coding classroom.
This is where it all began. Your love of computers, coding and a little hacking.
You notice ther are only 2 people in the class. It's your year 7 coding teacher,
Miss Wack, and a student who looks like one of your old classmates, Billy. At
the exact same time (which is a little creepy), they say, "Talk to me..."

Who do you talk to? (Use "r" for Miss Rack or "b" for Billy)
