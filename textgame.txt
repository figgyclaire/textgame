intro:
You are sitting in your dark, cold and damp basement. You \
can hear the soft pattering of rain and the clicks of your keyboard keys. \
Staring into the screen, you close your social media tabs, close a kind-of \
sketchy website called BuyThis, all the games you downloaded and finally your \
hacking platform.\n\nJust as you were about to Google "Funny Memes" to finish \
off your night when suddenly an ad flashes onto your screen. This is what you \
have been looking for your whole life- Gumanji, the game where the best of the \
best gamers battle it out for the ultimate glory. You\'ve never seen a single \
picture, review or anything about this game other that its name and how hard \
it is to come across. Engulfed by happiness, you immediately click on the \
screen.\n\nSuddenly your screen brightens, the basement starts to shake, your \
cat shrieks and runs away and your body seems to be dissolving into the \
computer screen...

casey's room:
You\'re lying on the floor, your stomach feels sick and \
your vision is blurry. As you stand up, you feel normal again. You look up \
and notice 3 hearts above your head. What is this and where am I? It feels \
like something out of a video game. As your eyes unblur, you notice you are \
in your year 7 coding classroom. This is where it all began. Your love of \
computers, coding and a little hacking. You notice ther are only 2 people in \
the class. It's your year 7 coding teacher, Miss Wack, and a student who looks \
like one of your old classmates, Billy. At the exact same time (which is a \
little creepy), they say, "Talk to me..."\n\nWho do you talk to? (Use "r" for \
Miss Rack or "b" for Billy) 

yash's room:
You step into a dark, gloomy room with only one dull light hanging from the \
ceiling. You notice that you now have 3 hearts above your head again. As you \
start to look around, you see lots of blobs floating mysteriously in the air. \
They are an unusual green and yellow in colour and their shape feels familiar. \
However, you can't identify what they are. You get goosebumps on your arms and \
start to feel scared, so you slowly tremble towards the door on the other side \
of the room. Ah yes- you think tp youself, those blobs are infact viruses! \
Standing in awe of these mysterious viruses, you realise that the viruses are \
slowly floating towards you. You try to run away, but your legs are frozen to \
the floor. Suddenly, one of the viruses has inched itself closer towards you, \
almost at eye level, and it asks you a question in a glitchy, sniffly voice.

kadie's room:
You slide out of the tunnel, dazed and confused. To your left, you see a \
lantern and to your right, a long, dark corridor awaits you.\nGo left or right?
left-
You grab the lantern, it suddenly lights- scaring you. You look around only to \
see the room is made from cold, dark walls, unlike the other interesting \
levels you have passed. You have noticed that you have reached a dead end. \
Your only choice now is to head right, down the dark corridoor.
right-
You stumble around aimlessly through the dark corridor, but turn back to fetch \
the lantern, regretting your decision of not grabbing it before. When you pick \
up the lantern, it suddenly lights- scaring you. You look around only to see \
the room is made from cold, dark walls, unlike the other interesting levels \
you have passed. You have noticed that you have reached a dead end. Your only \
choice now is to head right, down the dark corridor.
continue-
Your lantern illuminates the corridor, revealing wires lining the roof. \
Confused, you continue until you stumble onto something- maybe a wire, until \
suddenly, the wires on top of the roof start to illuminate- revealing neon \
lights that will guide you through the tunnel.\n\nWhen you reach the end of \
the tunnel, you come to another dark room- you reach for you lantern, but it \
won't turn on and suddenly, it disappears into thin air. Standing in the dark, \
you carefully and slowly walk forward, reaching out to ensure you don't crash \
in to anything.\nDo you want to look for a light switch or walk around the \
room? (Use "l" for light switch or use "w" for walk around room)
light switch-
You travel alongside the edge of the room, feeling the wall in search for a \
light switch. When you get back to the doorway where you entered, you \
discovered there is no light switch. Your only choice now is to look around \
the room.
look around room-
You walk around slowly, with outstretched arms, until suddenly, you feel \
something in the middle of the room. It feels like a pedestal with a large \
button on top.\n\nYou decide to press the button but when you pressed it, \
large, bright rectangles appear to be floating in the air. No, that can't be \
right- you think to yourself, and blink several times in confusion, allowing \
your eyes to adjust. When everything is clearer, you realise the floating \
rectangles are your posts, searches, passwords and your...PERSONAL INFORMATION\
!?!?!?!
