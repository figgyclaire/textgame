You walk around slowly, with outstretched arms, until suddenly, you feel
something in the middle of the room. It feels like a pedestal with a large
button on top.\n\nYou decide to press the button but when you pressed it, large,
bright rectangles appear to be floating in the air. No, that can't be right- you
think to yourself, and blink several times in confusion, allowing your eyes to
adjust. When everything is clearer, you realise the floating rectangles are your
posts, searches, passwords and your...PERSONAL INFORMATION!?!?!?!
