You lose your footing, slip and fall but it seems that you haven’t hit the
ground yet. It was only around 6 seconds later when you did, but for some reason
you kept on going down, just not while in the air. You were in some slide tunnel
or something and it was going extremely fast which kind of made you panic. Air
whooshed past you, whistling in your ears. It was originally so quiet, even your
presence echoed. Finally, a peak of light was visible and the next second, you
were out in the open. It was bright and you could barely see a thing, so you
squinted around the room and to your surprise, you were back in your basement

surroundings. 

What happened next really startled you as the other you suddenly spoke with a
mischievous grin, “Let’s play a game, shall we?” 

It doesn’t seem like there is any other choice, so you accept as you stared up

“Turn around now,” instructed the larger you so you could face the screen. On
there, it said, “Trivia.” Not more questions you thought in dread, but you knew
you had to do it. You take a deep breath as your clone clicks on start...
