Your lantern illuminates the corridor, revealing wires lining the roof. \
Confused, you continue until you stumble onto something- maybe a wire, until \
suddenly, the wires on top of the roof start to illuminate- revealing neon \
lights that will guide you through the tunnel.\n\nWhen you reach the end of \
the tunnel, you come to another dark room- you reach for you lantern, but it \
won't turn on and suddenly, it disappears into thin air. Standing in the dark, \
you carefully and slowly walk forward, reaching out to ensure you don't crash \
in to anything.\nDo you want to look for a light switch or walk around the \
room? (Use "l" for light switch or use "w" for walk around room)
